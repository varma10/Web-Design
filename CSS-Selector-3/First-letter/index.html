<p>In a kingdom far, far away lived a king and his three daughters.
  The king loved them very much for they were good and beautiful girls,
  but one day he decided to test how much they loved him.
</p>

<p>The king gathered his daughters around him and asked each of them the same question: “How much do you love me?”
  “Oh, father," said the eldest daughter, “I love you as much as all the diamonds and all the rubies in the world and more!” "That is excellent," said the king happily.
  “Dear father," said the second daughter, “I love you as much as all the gold and silver in the world and more!” “Wonderful!” said her father and smiled.
</p>

<p>Then it was the youngest daughter’s turn. “My father and king, I love you as much as all the salt in the world and more!”
  The king was very surprised at her answer. “What did you say? I think I must have misheard you," frowned the king.
  “I said that I love you as much as salt," repeated the youngest daughter.
  “How dare you! Your sisters love me as much as diamonds and gold, and you love me as little as salt," said the king angrily.
  "Leave this kingdom right now and never come back!”
  The little princess hid herself in the woods, but she soon got very tired.
  She sat on a log and started to cry, when a prince, who was passing by on his steed, heard her.
  As soon as he saw the pretty princess, the young prince fell in love with her.</p>
